   <h5>Mondrian Painting Project</h5>
   <p>What is a Piet Mondrian Painting?</p>
   <p>Piet Mondrian, a pioneering figure in the realm of abstract art, left an indelible mark on the trajectory of modern painting with his iconic compositions characterized by geometric shapes and primary colors. Renowned for his distinctive style, Mondrianâ€™s oeuvre reflects a profound exploration of harmony, balance, and the essence of pure form. Among his most celebrated works are pieces such as Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow, Broadway Boogie Woogie, and Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow, each embodying his philosophical quest for a universal visual language. Through his relentless pursuit of simplicity and clarity, Mondrian not only revolutionized the visual arts but also laid the groundwork for the development of abstract expressionism and minimalist aesthetics in the 20th century.</p>
   <p>So we have been assigned to take this Piet Mondrian concept and apply it with a CSS Grid Layout. This becomes a very complex CSS Grid layout, with very specific design requirements.</p>
