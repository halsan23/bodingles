   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>I have computer interests stretching back to the late 1980s. My first computer was a Texas Instruments TI-99a. From there I moved to a IBM PC jr, to an Apple II, and finally to a Compaq 486sx. This was the last computer I ever bought as I have been building my own since then. I currently own three Desktops, three Laptops and two Tablets.</p>
   <p>I started writing code with the IBM and learned MS-DOS and Basic. Later I learned HTML, CSS1, PHP, and SQL, but it has been many years since I practiced the art of programming. I am now retired and have the time needed to get back in the saddle.</p>
   <p>I am currently taking classes for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, and SQL. I consider myself to be very dedicated and a hard worker, willing to take the time to learn how to doa job properly.</p>
