            <h6>Intro</h6>
            <p><span class="firstWord">T</span>he Drum Roll app is an exercise in adding eventListener's for both a mouse click, and also a keypress, to accomplish the same output. We are also going to see how to play sounds with JavaScript. The finished app can be <a href="../../../courseProjects/drumRoll/drumRoll.html" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p>
            <p>To start we need our sound and image files for the various drum components. These can be found in the following folders:
               <ul>
                  <li><img src="/images/folder_16x16.png" alt="folder icon">&nbsp;&nbsp;images
                     <ul>
                        <li>crash.png</li>
                        <li>kick.png</li>
                        <li>snare.png</li>
                        <li>tom1.png</li>
                        <li>tom2.png</li>
                        <li>tom3.png</li>
                        <li>tom4.png</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><img src="/images/folder_16x16.png" alt="folder icon">&nbsp;&nbsp;sounds
                     <ul>
                        <li>crash.mp3</li>
                        <li>kick.mp3</li>
                        <li>snare.mp3</li>
                        <li>tom1.mp3</li>
                        <li>tom2.mp3</li>
                        <li>tom3.mp3</li>
                        <li>tom4.mp3</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </p><br>
         </article><hr><br>

         <!-- HTML -->
         <article>
            <h6>The HTML</h6>
            <p><span class="firstWord">N</span>ow, the basic HTML is pretty simple and the complete code will be listed below, but basically, we're going to set up a &lt;div> container and fill it with buttons that represent the different drum kit components.
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li>&lt;div class="set">
                     <ul>
                        <li>&lt;button class="w drum"><b>w</b>&lt;/button></li>
                        <li>&lt;button class="a drum"><b>a</b>&lt;/button></li>
                        <li>&lt;button class="s drum"><b>s</b>&lt;/button></li>
                        <li>&lt;button class="d drum"><b>d</b>&lt;/button></li>
                        <li>&lt;button class="j drum"><b>j</b>&lt;/button></li>
                        <li>&lt;button class="k drum"><b>k</b>&lt;/button></li>
                        <li>&lt;button class="l drum"><b>l</b>&lt;/button></li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>&lt;/div></li>
               </ul>
            So our container has a class of <b>set</b>. But notice how each drum component has two classes assigned, <b>a letter</b> and <b>drum</b>.</p>
            <p>The <b>letter</b> class allows for CSS styling to produce the proper drum image for each letter. So each drum image is produced in the CSS and is controlled by the letter that identifies each drum component. The <b>letter</b> is also assigned as a <b>label</b>, to indicate which key the user needs to press to press to get the drum sound. These are controlled with a "keydown" eventListener.</p>
            <p>The <b>drum</b> class is used by the JavaScript to identify that a drum component has been <b>clicked</b>. This is controlled with a "click" eventListener.</p>
            <p>The scheme is that you can either "click" a drum component image to get a sound, or you can "press" the corresponding key to get the sound.</p><br>
         </article><hr><br>

         <!-- the JavaScript -->
         <article>
            <h6>The JavaScript</h6>
            <p><span class="firstWord">F</span>or the JavaScript, the first thing we should do is to create a "click" eventListener to see if a drum image was clicked on. Since we gave all of the buttons a class of <b>.drum</b>, we can use a <b>for loop</b> to add a "click" eventListener to each drum component. From there we can use the keyword <span class="colorRed">this</span> to determine which drum image was actually clicked.
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li><b>The "click" eventListener</b></li>
                  <li class="commentStyle">// loop through all of the HTML elements that have a class of <b>drum</b></li>
                  <li>for ( let i = 0; i < document.<span class="colorOrange">querySelectorAll</span>('<b>.drum</b>').length; i++) {
                     <ul>
                        <li>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li class="commentStyle">// add a "click" eventListener to each of these items</li>
                        <li>document.querySelectorAll('.drum')[i].<span class="colorOrange">addEventListener</span>('<b>click</b>', function () {
                           <ul>
                              <li>&nbsp;</li>
                              <li class="commentStyle">// add the innerHTML (this is the HTML button label), to a variable</li>
                              <li>let <span class="colorGreen">buttonInnerHTML</span> = <span class="colorRed">this</span>.innerHTML;</li>
                              <li>&nbsp;</li>
                              <li class="commentStyle">// run the function to produce the sound</li>
                              <li><span class="colorPurple">makeSound</span>(<span class="colorGreen">buttonInnerHTML</span>);</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>});</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>}</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>So we're going to run through all of the HTML elements that have a class of <b>.drum</b>. In our app this will be all of the HTML Buttons that represent a drum component. And for each element:
               <ul>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">attach a "click" eventListener to it</li>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">take the letter, (this is the button <b>label</b>, (innerHTML)) that represents <i><span class="colorRed">this</span></i> drum, and assign it to the  variable <span class="colorGreen">buttonInnerHTML</span>
                     <ul>
                        <li><i>in this instance, <span class="colorRed">this</span> refers to the individual item in our <b>for</b> loop</i></li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">call the <span class="colorPurple">makeSound()</span> function, passing in our variable (<span class="colorGreen">buttonInnerHTML</span>), to actually produce the appropriate drum sound</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Note that we are using <i><span class="colorRed">this</span></i> to represent each individual item as we progress through the <b>for</b> loop.</p><hr>
            <p>And next we should create our eventListener for our <b>key presses</b>.
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li><b>The "keydown" eventListener</b></li>
                  <li>document.<span class="colorOrange">addEventListener</span>('<b>keydown</b>', (<span class="colorBlue">evt</span>) => {
                     <ul>
                        <li>makeSound(<span class="colorBlue">evt</span>.<span class="colorRed">key</span>);</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>});</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This is pretty simple and straight forward:
               <ul>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">We are adding a <b>keydown</b> eventListener that is checking the entire document for a key "down" press.</li>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">We are passing in an argument (<span class="colorBlue">evt</span>) that is used to determine which key is pressed
                     <ul>
                        <li class="commentStyle">- if we console.log(<span class="colorBlue">evt</span>) we can get all kinds of information on the key that was pressed</li>
                        <li class="commentStyle">- one of these properties is <span class="colorRed">key</span> which tells us exactly which key was pressed</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">finally we call the <span class="colorPurple">makeSound()</span> function, passing in the data, (<span class="colorBlue">evt</span>.<span class="colorRed">key</span>) for which key was pressed.</li>
               </ul>
            </p><hr>
            <p>So whether we click on a drum image, or press the appropriate key, we should end up with the same variable being passed into the <span class="colorPurple">makeSound()</span> function. This variable will be a letter that either comes from the <b>button innerHTML</b> or from the <b>keypress</b> which produces <span class="colorBlue">evt</span>.<span class="colorRed">key</span>.</p>
            <p>And now that we have our <b>letter</b> that we can pass in to our <span class="colorPurple">makeSound()</span> function, let's go ahead and build the function.</p><br>
         </article><hr><br>

         <!-- the makeSound function -->
         <article>
            <h6>The makeSound() function</h6>
            <p><span class="firstWord">S</span>o we're building a function that is going to have one argument passed into it. This is the letter that represents which drum component was selected, either by a mouse click, or by a key press. And because we a trying to process a letter, the <b>Switch/Case</b> method is the best way to go.</p>
            <p>The <b>switch</b> statement is used to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of an expression (in our case, the letter that is being passed into the function).</p>
            <p>The <b>switch</b> expression is then evaluated, and if it matches the value of one of the <b>case</b> labels, the code block associated with that case is executed. If <b>none</b> of the case labels match the value of the expression, the code block associated with the <b>default</b> clause is executed.</p>
            <p>So our <span class="colorPurple">makeSound()</span> function will look something like this:
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li>function <span class="colorPurple">makeSound</span> (<span class="colorGreen">key</span>) {
                     <ul>
                        <li>switch (<span class="colorGreen">key</span>) {
                           <ul>
                              <li>case "<b>w</b>":
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>let <span class="colorGreen">tom1</span> = <span class="colorOrange">new</span> Audio(`./sounds/<b>tom-1.mp3</b>`);</li>
                                    <li><span class="colorGreen">tom1</span>.<span class="colorPurple">play()</span>;</li>
                                    <li>break;</li>
                                 </ul>
                              </li>
                              <li>case "<b>a</b>":
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>let <span class="colorGreen">tom2</span> = <span class="colorOrange">new</span> Audio(`./sounds/<b>tom-2.mp3</b>`);</li>
                                    <li><span class="colorGreen">tom2</span>.<span class="colorPurple">play()</span>;</li>
                                    <li>break;</li>
                                 </ul>
                              </li>
                              <li>...</li>
                              <li>...</li>
                              <li><b>default</b>:
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>alert(`Incorrect Key "${key}" Pressed!!`);</li>
                                 </ul>
                              </li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>}</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>}</li>
               </ul>
            Let's break this down.</p>
            <p>First off, we're only showing the code for the first two <b>case</b> match possibilities. Remember, our letters that will be passed into the function are limited to: w, a, s, d, j, k, and l. We've shown th code for w, and a, and the rest of the case code blocks will be the same except for the variable names and the mp3 that is being called.</p>
            <p>So we are passing in our "key" letter and processing it through the <b>case</b> code blocks. If the letter passed in is NOT one of our letters, (w, a, s, d, j, k, l) then the <b>default</b> code block runs and in this case, just identifies that a key outside of our range was pressed.</p>
            <p>If the key matches one of our <b>case</b> conditions that that code block will run and play the appropriate mp3 file. Lets break that code down:
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li>let <span class="colorGreen">tom1</span> = <span class="colorOrange">new</span> Audio(`./sounds/<b>tom-1.mp3</b>`);</li>
                  <li><span class="colorGreen">tom1</span>.<span class="colorPurple">play()</span>;</li>
                  <li>break;</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Umm, what is this <span class="colorOrange">new</span> keyword and what does it mean? Well, <span class="colorOrange">new</span> is signifying that this is a "<b>High Function</b>", also known as a "<b>Higher-order Function</b>".</p>
            <p><b>Higher-order functions</b> in JavaScript are functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as output.</p>
            <p>In our case, the <span class="colorOrange">new</span> Audio (Higher-order function) is selecting a file path and then outputting the <span class="colorPurple">play()</span> function, to play the audio file specified in the path statement.</p>
            <p>So we are using a <b>Higher-order Function</b> get a filepath to a file, assign it to a variable, and then output the file using the <span class="colorPurple">play()</span> function.</p>
            <p>The <b>break</b> statement at the end of each <b>case</b> code block simple exits out of the switch statement.</p>

         <!-- Drum Animation -->
         <article>
            <h6>Drum Animation</h6>
            <p><span class="firstWord">W</span>e should have everything running nicely now, but let's add one more piece. How about when we select a drum either by mouse click, or by key press, let's add some type of animation that gives a visual cue that the drum was selected.
            </p>
            <p>In order to accomplish this, we're going to create the following function:
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li>function <span class="colorPurple">buttonAnimation</span> (<span class="colorGreen">currentKey</span>) {
                     <ul>
                        <li>let <span class="colorGreen">activeButton</span> = document.querySelector("<b>.</b>" + <span class="colorGreen">currentKey</span>);</li>
                        <li><span class="colorGreen">activeButton</span>.<span class="colorBlue">classList</span>.<span class="colorOrange">add</span>("<b>pressed</b>");</li>
                        <li>setTimeout(function() {
                           <ul>
                              <li><span class="colorGreen">activeButton</span>.<span class="colorBlue">classList</span>.<span class="colorOrange">remove</span>("<b>pressed</b>");</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>}, 175);</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>}</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>So we've created a function that is going to have one variable passed in to it. This variable will be the <b>letter</b> of the drum component that was selected, (w, a, s, d, j, k, l).</p>
            <p>We're going to use <b>classList</b> to add our animation. <b>classList</b> can return all of the classes assigned to an HTML element. But it has some interesting properties such as:
               <ul>
                  <li><b>add</b> - adds a new class to an HTML element</li>
                  <li><b>remove</b> - removes a class from an HTML element.</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Since we're working with classes, we need to convert our variable that is passed into the function, (<span class="colorGreen">currentKey</span>), into a class. Our second line of code does that by adding a dot (<b>.</b>) before the <b>letter</b> that was passed in. So <span class="colorGreen">activeButton</span> becomes a class name that represents the drum component that was selected.</p>
            <p>So if you look at the drum components, you see the letters are a blue color with a yellow glow effect around them. We already have a class that defines that.</p>
            <p>But our next line of code:
               <ul>
                  <li><span class="colorGreen">activeButton</span>.<span class="colorBlue">classList</span>.<span  class="colorOrange">add</span>("<b>pressed</b>");</li>
               </ul>
            is <b>adding</b> a NEW class (<b>pressed</b>) to this HTML element only. So all we have to do is write a new class rule for the class <b>pressed</b>. In our case we are simply going to change the <span style="color: #041dda;">blue</span> text color to <span style="color: #da0404;">red</span>. In the css file:
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li><b>css</b></li>
                  <li>.pressed {
                     <ul>
                        <li>color: #da0404;</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>}</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Now we don't want the text to stay red, so we've added a timeout function, and after 175ms, we will reove the class from the element with the line of code:
               <ul>
                  <li><span class="colorGreen">activeButton</span>.<span class="colorBlue">classList</span>.<span class="colorOrange">remove</span>("<b>pressed</b>");</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Now we should understand that we are not creating a new class with <b>classList.add</b>. The class <b>pressed</b> is created in our CSS stylesheet. All we are doing is adding, and then removing the class, to one single HTML element.</p>
            <h6>and finally</h6>
            <p>We need to call this function. And the place to call it is right after we call our <span class="colorPurple">makeSound()</span> function to that whether we select a drum component with a mouse click, or with a key press, we still get the visual animation.</p>
            <p>So we need to call the function from two places:
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li>Inside the "<b>click</b>" event:</li>
                  <li>after: <span class="colorPurple">makeSound</span>(<span class="colorGreen">buttonInnerHTML</span>);</li>
                  <li>add: <span class="colorPurple">buttonAnimation</span>(<span class="colorGreen">buttonInnerHTML</span>);</li>
               </ul>
            and
               <ul class="sectHighlight">
                  <li>Inside the "<b>keypress</b>" event:</li>
                  <li>after: <span class="colorPurple">makeSound</span>(evt.<span class="colorRed">key</span>);</li>
                  <li>add: <span class="colorPurple">buttonAnimation</span>(evt.<span class="colorRed">key</span>);</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
