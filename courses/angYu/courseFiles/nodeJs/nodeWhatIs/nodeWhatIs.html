         <h6>What is Node.Js</h6>
         <p><span class="firstWord">T</span>echnically: Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. It runs on the V8 JavaScript engine and executes JavaScript code <b>outside</b> a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.</p>
         <p>Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games). Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows users to run JavaScript outside the browser. Node.js can speed up processing times and is easy to set up.
         </p>
         <p>Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts. Node.js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications. It runs on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, and it uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.</p>

         <p><span class="firstWord">P</span>hew. That's um... ya.</p>
         <p>What this means is that Node.Js allows us to write JavaScript code <b>externally</b> from the web browser. This gives us the ability to use one language (JavaScript), to write the functional code for both the <b>Front-End</b> and <b>Back-End</b> web development. So we can use JavaScript to create the functionality on the client side, and also write the server code to create all of the functionality on the server side.</span>
         <p>Another bonus is that programmers can write code, that can be reused as <b>modules</b>. These modules can be incorporated into your code which saves you the time, since you don't have to completely write all of the code. Think of it like <b>Bootstrap</b>. You don't write the Bootstrap classes, you just manipulate them to get the output you need.</p>
